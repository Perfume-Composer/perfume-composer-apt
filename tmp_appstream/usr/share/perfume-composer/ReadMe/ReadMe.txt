To disable Bluetooth connection and disconnection notifications in Linux Mint, particularly those related to device pairing or connection, you can disable the "ConnectionNotifier" plugin within the Blueman Bluetooth manager. Right-click the Bluetooth icon in the system tray, select "Plugins" from the menu, and uncheck the "ConnectionNotifier" option. This will stop the notifications that appear when a Bluetooth device connects or disconnects.
